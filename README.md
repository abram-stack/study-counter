# Study-Session Counter

I am so inspired by the Pomodoro studying techniques! 
Once you finished your study session you can increase the counter by pressing the button, afterward you can save each session.

Basic Counter App using JavaScript.

With JavaScript we will able to read the HTML document element and manipulate the DOM(Document Object Model)
to render the content to the client based on the interaction with the app.


Happy Coding!
